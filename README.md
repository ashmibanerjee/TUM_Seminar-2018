Master-Seminar in Wintersemester 2018/19: Current Topics in Recommender Systems

## Automatic Preference Elicitation from Social Media (Presenter: Ashmi	Banerjee, Advisor: Linus Dietz)

It is said that Facebook, Google and Twitter know you better than yourself. If this was true, 
it would be a fruitful information source not only for targeted advertisement, but for personalized recommendations 
in other domains. An exemplary task would how to derive e.g., traveler types from public information of a social media profile.
This could include posts, pictures and additional metadata like locations. Neidhardt et al. established the Seven Factor Model 
for traveler types. Is it possible to reliably derive the traveler type from a social media profile? How could this be 
implemented in the different social network platforms and evaluated using real persons?
